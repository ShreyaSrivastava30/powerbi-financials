In this task, I have taken a financial data and did its analysis using python. 
After doing cleaning part and visualizations, these are the insights are observed:

PROFIT BY DATE
       Looking at the change in profit with time, it is increasing and the last date of the whole dataset has the maximum profit, which is a good sign.

PROFIT BY COUNTRY
       Looking into profit country wise, France is giving us the maximum profit

PRODUCT
       ‘Paseo’ is giving is giving us the maximum sales.

SEGMENT
       If we will look into segment, government segments are most profitable for us followed by small business             and enterprises. Mid market and channel partners are really negligible compared to other segments.
